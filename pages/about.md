### Raj Nath Patel

**Research Interests**: I am interested in neural/statistical machine translation/transliteration, 
Neural/statistical language modeling, quality evaluation and estimation, part-of-speech tagging, 
and parsing. Current projects include ”Personalized Neural Machine Translation”, 
”Translation Quality Estimation using Deep Learning”, and 
”Recurrent Neural Network based Part-of-Speech tagging”.

**Specialties/Areas of Interest**: Natural Language Processing & Deep Learning

**Skills**: Analytical researcher with more than eight years of experience in Natural 
Language Processing. Good grasp in Neural Networks (Transformer, Convolution, 
and Recurrent Neural Network), Statistical/Probabilistic modeling and machine learning algorithms. 
Experience in developing/working with open source projects.


### Research Contributions
[comment]: <> (* Efficient Multi-Lingual Sentence Classification Framework with Sentence Meta Encoders, )

[comment]: <> (  The work resulted to a long [industry track long paper]&#40;&#41;, to be published in IEEE BigData 2021. )

* Improving Robustness in Real-World Neural Machine Translation Engines, 
  The work resulted in a [user track long paper](https://aclanthology.org/W19-6727.pdf) published in the Machine Translation Summit XVII, 2019. 
  
* English to Indian Language Statistical Machine Translation with language-specific preprocessing, 
  The work resulted in a [long journal paper](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jisys-2018-0014/html) published in the Journal of Intelligent Systems, 2019. 
  
* Personalized Machine Translation: Preserving Original Author Traits, 
  which is in collaboration with University of Sheffield, United Kingdom; IBM Research-Haifa, Israel; 
  University of Haifa, Israel; The work resulted in a [long EACL paper](https://aclanthology.org/E17-1101.pdf), EACL (European Chapter of the Association for Computation Linguistics) is one of the most prestigious conferences in the field, with acceptance rates below 25\%.

* Recurrent Neural Network based Translation Quality Estimation, 
  which resulted in a [long WMT (ACL 2016) paper](https://aclanthology.org/W16-2389.pdf), WMT (Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation) conference is known for organising different NLP shared tasks including machine translation, quality evaluation and estimation, automatic post-editing, and bilingual document alignment and produces state-of-the-art techniques for these tasks.

* Recurrent Neural Network based Pasrts-Of-Speech Tagging for social media code-mixed text, 
  this is the first attempt using deep learning in the Indian language code-mixed NLP, 
  the work resulted in a [short ICON paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04989.pdf), ICON (International Conference on Natural Language Processing) is a well known and the only Indian conference for natural language processing and computational linguistics.
  
* Reordering rules for English to Indian languages Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) to 
  reduce the syntactic divergence between source and target languages 
  which resulted in a [long HyTra (ACL 2013) paper](https://aclanthology.org/W13-2807.pdf), HyTra (Hybrid Approaches to Translation) is a prestigious workshop in the area of Hybrid machine translation.
  
* Morphological analysis for Dravidian languages to Hindi SMT which includes 
  Suffix Separation and Compound Word Splitting to reduce the morphological divergence 
  between source and target languages. The work resulted in a [long paper](https://aclanthology.org/W14-5102.pdf) and 
  two short papaers ICON papers.
